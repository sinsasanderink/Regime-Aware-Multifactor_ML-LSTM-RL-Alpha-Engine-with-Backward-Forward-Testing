# Regime-Aware Multifactor + ML/RL Alpha Engine with Backward & Forward Testing  

**⚠️ Status:** *Work in Progress — core architecture, model training pipelines, and validation framework are being actively developed.*  

## Overview  
This project is a **modular trading research system** designed to generate **pure alpha** — returns independent of market beta — by combining **proven multifactor principles** with **modern ML and RL techniques**, all validated through a robust **statistical testing framework**.  

The engine targets **cross-sectional mispricings** within a broad large-cap U.S. equity universe (S&P 500), dynamically selecting top-N long/short candidates by confidence for short-term horizons (5–10 days).

## Core Components  

### 1. Multifactor Alpha Layer  
Applies a **regime-aware blend** of factors:  
- **Value**: Cheap stocks with mean-reversion potential.  
- **Momentum**: Persistent trend identification.  
- **Quality**: Strong balance sheets and operational efficiency.  
- Factor blending with **shrinkage** to mitigate overfitting.  

### 2. Machine Learning Overlays  
- **LSTM**: Captures temporal dependencies in returns, volatility, and technical indicators.  
- **LightGBM/XGBoost/MLP**: Detects nonlinear interactions in cross-sectional features.  
- **Stacking meta-learner**: Combines factor and ML predictions optimally.  
- **Uncertainty quantification**: MC-dropout and quantile regression guide position sizing.  

### 3. Regime Detection  
- **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** classifies markets as **Risk-On**, **Risk-Off**, or **Transition**, adapting factor weights and model usage dynamically.  

### 4. Portfolio Construction & Risk Management  
- **Black–Litterman optimization** for integrating model views with market-implied returns.  
- **Risk parity** to balance sector and factor exposures.  
- **Dynamic hedging** against SPY and sector ETFs to ensure market neutrality.  

### 5. Reinforcement Learning Alpha Sizing  
- **PPO agent** learns a regime-aware sizing/hedging policy.  
- Optimizes **return per unit of tail risk** (CVaR-aware reward).

## Testing & Validation  

### Backward Testing (Historical)  
- **Walk-forward analysis** with purged cross-validation.  
- Statistical tests: **Diebold–Mariano, SPA/White Reality Check**.  
- **Monte Carlo block bootstrap** for confidence intervals and failure probability.  
- **VaR/CVaR** and historical stress scenarios for risk assessment.  

### Forward Testing (Shadow Mode)  
- **Daily simulation** using only forward data, logging PnL and risk.  
- Weekly retraining, monthly tear sheets vs. backtest benchmarks.  
- Forward-testing period recommendation: **4–12 weeks** before paper/live trading.

## Project Goals  
- Deliver **consistent, statistically validated alpha** with **low market correlation** and **controlled drawdowns**.  
- Use **hybrid factor + ML + RL approach** for robustness.  
- Ensure real-capital deployment only after **multi-layer validation**.
